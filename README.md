# APP-HD-pattern-runner

This is an auxiliary repository, containing example runner scripts and configuration files
for the reproducibility of the R&D work presented in 
Chapter 5 of my [dissertation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cow9vys7wrl1kqj/thesis_aszabo.pdf?dl=0).

The scripts and configs are to be used together with tools in these 
repositories:
- [ProteinPatternSearch](https://github.com/ador/ProteinPatternSearch)
- [PhyTreeSearch](https://github.com/ador/PhyTreeSearch).
